# Knowledge Based AI Agents
This repository contains my solutions to the Lecture 1 of [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/).

There are two challenges in this sections:
- Knights and Knaves game
- Minesweeper

Both projects are related to Knowledge Based (KB) AI agents.

## Knights and Knaves challenge
In the first challenge the student has to provide a list of `Sentences` inside the `knowledge` variable used by the AI agent to infer, given a knights and knaves puzzle, who is actually a knight or a knave.

Take a look at the `puzzle.py` file, and run `ptyhon puzzle.py` if you want to find out the solution. For more details about the game and the challenge, visit the [project page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/1/knights/)

## Minesweeper
